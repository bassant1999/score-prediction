# score-prediction

## The Problem:
Build a model to predict the percentage of Score that a student is expected to get based upon the number of hours studied using a linear regression method.

What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day?


## The Solution:
This is a regression problem; Regression is a type of supervised Machine Learning; supervised machine learning  is the field of machine learning  that is used to train a model  based on labelled data. 

I will use linear regression to solve it; The overall idea of linear regression is to get a line that best represents the relation between dependent variable and independent variable(s). The form of the regression equation is defined by the formula y = b0 + b1*x1 +b2*x2 +..., where y = estimated dependent variable score, b0 = constant, b1, b2,..are regression coefficients, and x1, x2,... are the independent variables. 

Here we have one dependent variable which is the scoreâ€™s percentage of the student and one independent variable which is hours studied by the student. 

The steps: 

1-  Importing Libraries
2- Importing the dataset
3- Data Visualisation and Analysis
4- Extracting the Independent and Dependent variables
5- Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
6- Training the model on training set
7- Evaluating the Model on testing set
8- What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day ?
